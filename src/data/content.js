  bio: [
    "I'm a Data Science student in my final years, focused on the full pipeline — from messy raw data to models that hold up in production. My recent work spans churn prediction, opinion mining on business review data, and healthcare analytics dashboards, along with full-stack systems like an ERP for a small manufacturing business and a deals-aggregation platform. I care less about running a notebook once and more about building things that keep working.",
    "Outside of core ML/data work, I've also built with blockchain and enjoy projects that sit at the intersection of data engineering and product — dashboards people actually check, models that plug into real workflows. Based in Lahore, Pakistan, currently looking for opportunities in data science, analytics, or ML engineering.",
